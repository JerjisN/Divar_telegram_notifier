# divar_telegram_notifier
This Python script checks for new car advertisements on Divar using its API and sends notifications to a Telegram bot. It is designed to run periodically, keeping you updated on the latest ads.

## Configuration

1. Get your Telegram bot token by talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Replace `'your_telegram_bot_token'` with your actual bot token in the script.
3. Determine the chat ID where you want to receive notifications and replace `'your_telegram_chat_id'` with the actual chat ID in the script.
